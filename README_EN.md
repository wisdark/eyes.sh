#### Prepare Domain Names 

 Let's have `eyes.sh`  installation as a show case.

When install the service，you were required to control two domain names（One is to add two type `A` records,  and later set them as `NS` records for `eyes.sh`）

* Add `eyes_dns1.lijiejie.com`  `eyes_dns2.lijiejie.com` , resolve to your Server IP
* Set `eyes_dns1.lijiejie.com`  `eyes_dns2.lijiejie.com` as  `eyes.sh` name server

```
eyes.sh nameserver = eyes_dns1.lijiejie.com
eyes.sh nameserver = eyes_dns2.lijiejie.com
```

#### Django 

This project works with **Python 3.8 + Django 4.0**， run `deploy.sh` to install dependencies.

* Modify TimeZone in settings.py 
* MySQL Server charset should be updated to utf-8

Edit `\dnslog\settings.py`, add your service domain，IP  and  `DATABASES` 

```
DNS_DOMAIN = 'eyes.sh'   # Service Domain
ADMIN_DOMAIN = ['eyes.sh', 'www.eyes.sh']  # Reserved domains to view records

# name server
NS1_DOMAIN = 'eyes_dns1.lijiejie.com'
NS2_DOMAIN = 'eyes_dns2.lijiejie.com'

SERVER_IP = '123.123.123.123'  # Your server IP
```

Nginx config file is `dnslog_nginx.conf`

#### Add Sys Admin

When install completed，**the first registerd user will become the sys admin by default**.
